## 1 Introduction

This project focuses in developing a full-stack web application aimed to provide an online learning platform. The aim of the platform is to allow users to browse, enroll, and offer courses on various topics. The goal was to create a functional, user-friendly interface with responsive design, ensuring accessibility across different devices. In addition, the backend supports secure user authentication, course management, and dynamic content rendering based on user roles.

Moreover, the project also involved creating a database structure to manage users, courses, and categories efficiently. Instructors can create new courses, while learners can browse and enroll in them based on their interests. The system also includes features like profile management, course details, and browsing to increase user good experience when accessing the site.
